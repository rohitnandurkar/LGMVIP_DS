# Twitter Sentiment Analysis 🔥

<p>
Sentiment Analysis is the automated process of determining whether a text expresses a positive, negative, or
neutral opinion about a product or topic. By using sentiment analysis, companies don’t have to spend endless
hours tagging customer data such as survey responses, reviews, support tickets, and social media comments.
Sentiment analysis helps companies monitor their brand reputation on social media, gain insights from customer
feedback, and much more! Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have increased the
efficiency of sentiment analysis algorithms. You can creatively use advanced artificial intelligence and machine
learning tools for doing research and draw out the analysis.
